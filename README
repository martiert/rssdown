This is a small program, which is used to download wanted links from rss feeds.

This is made to be a program to suite my personal needs, and is therefor quite limited.
If someone thinks this looks like something they might benefit from, but find the feature
set limited, please feel free to send me an enhancment request, or even a patch to add that
specific feature.

Even though this is written with my personal, quite small, use case in mind. I would be
happy to accomodate other peoples needs for something like this, be that cookies, more
sophisticated download paths or anything else you could think of.

I have tried to write tests, that should explain the features of this program, but they are
not complete. In the near future I will add more tests, and thereby documenting the features
better. I will also add a config template to ease the use of this program.
